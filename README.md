# ChinczykJava
## About

It's a java desktop application implementing classic board game called "Man, don't get angry" for 4 people. This version lets you play alone or with 3 other people (the rest of players would be bots). 
As a player you can choose one of 4 different colours and your nickname for the game. After that you can start your game until one of players finish the game with 4 of his counters on the ending fields. 

## How to run game

At first, you have to download every .png and .jar files from *"ChinczykJava\dist"* folder. You should have file called *"Chinczyk.jar"* (application itself) and 6 .png files with prefix *"counter"*. 
Before you run application, make sure you have JRE 13 on your machine. Then you can run *"Chinczyk.jar"* file. 

## Plans for future
* Creating option that player can save his game whenever he want and then continue the game later.
* Adding better animations to the game using multithreading
